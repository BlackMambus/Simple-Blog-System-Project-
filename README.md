# Simple-Blog-System-Project-
To fulfill this request for a simple console-based blog system in C++,
I will provide a single C++ file that implements the key features of a blog system that can run in the terminal. 
It should have the ability to:

Add a blog post (title and content)
List all blog posts (show titles and IDs)
View a blog post's content by selecting it
Delete a blog post by selecting it
Exit the program.
